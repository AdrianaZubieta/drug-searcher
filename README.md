Drugsearcher app gets data from:
https://open.fda.gov/apis/

All the concepts are defined in cards or accordions.

You can searh information on a drug by its generic or brand name, 
then by reactions, indications or interactions.

The results are given in a data frame with 
a gradient background according to the frequency
or a text in case of interactions.

If there are misspellings or the API doesn't find results 
an alert is shown.
